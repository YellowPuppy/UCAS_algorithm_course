Notice:\\\\
1. Due Nov. 15, 2010.\\
2. Please hand in your answer in hard copy.\\
3. You can arbitrarily choose 1 problem.\\\\
The following problems can be used for your reduction to prove NP-completeness: \\
{\sc SAT}, {\sc 3SAT}, {\sc Independent-Set}, {\sc Vertex-Cover}\\
{\sc 3-Coloring}, {\sc Set-Cover}, {\sc Subset-Sum}, {\sc Hamilton-Cycle}\\
% \section{P class (10 marks)}
% 
% Let {\sc 2SAT} be the set of satisfiable boolean formulas in $SAT$ with exactly $2$ literals per clause. Show that $2SAT\in P$.\\

\section{NP-completeness (10 marks)}

The {\sc subgraph-isomorphism} problem takes two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ and asks whether $G_1$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $G_2$. Show that the subgragh-isomorphism problem is NP-complete.

\section{NP-completeness (10 marks)}

Given an integer $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and an integer $m$-vector $b$, the {\sc 0-1 integer-programming} problem asks whether there is an integer $n$-vector $x$ with elements in the set $\{0,1 \}$ such that $Ax\geq b$. Prove that 0-1 integer programming is NP-complete.

\section{NP-completeness (10 marks)}

The {\sc set-partition} problem takes as input a set $S$ of numbers. The question is whether the numbers can be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ and $B = S-A$ such that $\Sigma_{x\in A} x=\Sigma_{x\in B} x$. Show that the set-partition problem is NP-complete.

\section{NP-completeness (10 marks)}

In the {\sc half-3SAT} problem, we are given a 3SAT formula $\phi$ with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses, where $m$ is even. We wish to determine whether there exists a truth assignment to the variables of $\phi$ such that exactly half the clauses evaluate to $0$ and exactly half the clauses evaluate to $1$. Prove that the $half-3SAT$ problem is NP-complete.

\section{NP-completeness (10 marks)}

Show that {\sc Undirected-Hamilton-Cycle} problem is NP-complete.\\
{\sc Undirected-Hamilton-Cycle(decision problem)}:\\
{\bf Input:} an undirected gragh $G$\\
{\bf Output:} 1 if $G$ has a Hamilton cycle which visits each vertex exactly once and also returns to the starting vertex, 0 for others\\

% \section{NP-comleteness (10 marks)}
% 
% Show that {\sc 3D-Matching} problem is NP-complete.\\
% {\sc 3D-Matching(decision problem)}:\\
% {\bf Input:} an integer $n$, 3 sets $A$, $B$, $C$ which all have $n$ elements, a set $M\subseteq A \times B \times C$\\
% {\bf Output:} 1 if there exists a subset $M^{'}$ of $M$, such that $|M^{'}|=n$ and $M$ contains all the elements in $A$, $B$, $C$, 0 for others
