\begin{itemize}
 \item Reduction: understanding the relationship between different problems. $A
\le_P B$ implies  ``B is harder than A''. 
 \item Problem classes: {\bf P}, {\bf NP}, {\bf coNP}, {\bf L}, {\bf NL}, {\bf PSPACE}, {\bf EXP}, etc. 
 \item {\sc Circuit Satisfiability} is one of the hardest problems in {\bf NP} class.

\frame{
\frametitle{ Complexity classes  }
\begin{itemize}
\item A complexity class of problems is specified by several parameters: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Computation model: multi-string Turing machine; 
 \item Computation mode: When do we think a machine accepts its input?
deterministic or non-deterministic?
 \item Computation resource: time, space. 
 \item Bound: a function $f$ to express how many resource can we use. 
 \end{enumerate}
\item The complexity class is then defined as the set of all languages decided by a multi-string Turing machine $M$ operating in the
deterministic/non-deterministic mode, and such that, for input $x$, $M$ uses at
most $f(|x|)$ units of time or space. 
\end{itemize}
(See ppt for description of Turing machine.)

\frametitle{ Deterministic versus nondeterministic } 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\textcolor{red}{\bf DTM}: In a deterministic Turing machine, the set of rules prescribes at most one action to be performed for any given situation. 
\item \textcolor{red}{\bf NTM}: A non-deterministic Turing machine (NTM), by contrast, may have a set of rules that prescribes more than one actions for a given situation. 
\item For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine may have both "If you are in state 2 and you see an 'A', change it to a 'B' and move left" and "If you are in state 2 and you see an 'A', change it to a 'C' and move right" in its rule set.

\item 
Perhaps the easiest way to understand determinism and nondeterminism is by looking at NFA and DFA. 
\item 
In a DFA, every state has exactly one outgoing arrow for every letter in the alphabet.
\item 
However, the NFA in state 1  has two possible transitions for the letter "b".

 Certificate: $x_1 = \texttt{TRUE}, x_2 = \texttt{TRUE}, x_3 = \texttt{FALSE}$;

For {\sc UNSAT} problem, it is difficult to provide a short ``certificate'':

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
A certifier can be used as the core of a ``brute-force'' algorithm to solve the problem: enumerate all possible certificate $t$ in $O(2^{|t|})$ time, and run $C(s, t)$. It will take exponential-time.  \\

\begin{itemize}
 \item Due to the absence of progress of {\bf P=NP?} question, a more approachable
question was posed: \\
	What is the hardest problems in {\bf NP}? 
\item This is approachable since by using polynomial-time reduction, one can find connection between problems, and
gain insight of the structure of {\bf NP}  class. 
\item The hardest problems in the $NP$ class:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
{\bf NP-hard}: a problem $Y$ is {\bf NP-hard}  if for \textcolor{red}{\bf any}
{\bf NP} problem $X$, $X \le_p Y$;
\item 
{\bf NP-complete}: a problem $Y$ is in {\bf NP}, and is {\bf NP-hard}.

\begin{theorem}
 Suppose $Y$ is a {\bf NP-complete} problem. $Y$ is solvable in polynomial-time
  iff {\bf P=NP}
\end{theorem}
\begin{Proof}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
Let $X$ be any problem in {\bf NP} ; 
 \item 
Since $X \le_P Y$, $X$ can be solved in polynomial-time through the ``reduction
algorithm''. 
%\item Conversely, Obvious. Since $Y$ is also in {\bf NP}.

\end{Proof}
\begin{itemize}

Consequence: if there is any problem in {\bf NP}  that cannot be solved in
polynomial-time, then no NP-Complete can be solved in polynomial-time.

 \item 
It is not at all obvious that {\bf NP-complete} problems should even exist. 
\item 
Two possible cases: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item two incomparable problem $X'$ and $X''$, and there is $no$ problem $X$
such that $X' \le_P X$, and $X'' \le_P X$? 
 \item an infinite sequence of problems $X_1 \le_P X_2 \le_P ... $;

certificate $t$ of length $p(|s|)$ such that $C(s,t) = Yes$.

$C(s,t)$ as a sequence of configurations.} \begin{scriptsize}
 Here, configuration refers to any particular state of computer, including

meet a certain goal, e.g., {\sc Set Cover}, {\sc Vertex Cover}.
 \item  {\sc Partitioning} problems: to divide them into subsets so that each object
appears in exactly one of the subsets, e.g., {\sc 3-Coloring}.  
 \item  {\sc Sequencing} problems: to search over all possible permutations of objects
under restrictions that some objects cannot follow certain others, e.g., {\sc
Hamilton Cycle}, {\sc TSP};
 \item  {\sc Numerical} problems: objects are weighted, to select objects to meet the
constraint on the total weights, e.g., {\sc Subset Sum}
 \item  {\sc Constraint satisfaction} problems. e.g., {\sc 3SAT}, {\sc Circuit
Satisfiability}.

 The asymmetry of {\bf NP} and {\bf coNP}

\frame{
\frametitle{The asymmetry of {\bf NP}}
{\bf NP} is fundamentally asymmetry since: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item For a ``Yes'' instance, we can provide a short ``certificate'' to support
it is ``Yes'';
 \item But for a ``No'' instance, no correspondingly short ``Disqualification''
is guaranteed; 
\end{itemize}
Example: $SAT$ vs. $UNSAT$. \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Certificate of a ``Yes'' instance: an assignment; \\
\item  Disqualification of a ``No'' instance: ? 
\end{itemize}

Example: {\sc Hamilton Cycle} vs. {\sc No Hamilton Cycle} \\
\begin{itemize}
 \item Certificate of a ``Yes'' instance: a permutation of nodes; \\
 \item Disqualification of a ``No'' instance: ?
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Problem $X$ and its complement $\bar{X}$}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
$\bar{X}$ has different property: $s$ is a ``Yes'' instance of $ \bar{X}$ iff
for \textcolor{red}{ALL} $t$ of length at most $p(|s|)$, we have $C(s,t)=No$. 
\item 
co-NP: the collection of $X$ if $\bar{X}$ is in {\bf NP}. \\

\end{itemize}
Example: $UNSAT$, {\sc No Hamilton Cycle}.

}

\frame{
\begin{block}{ Question 2: {\bf NP}  = {\bf coNP}? } 
 If yes, then the existence of short certificates for ``Yes'' instances means
that we can find short disqualifications for all ``No'' instances. 
\end{block}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{{\bf NP}  = {\bf coNP}?}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
Widespread belief: No. 
 \item Just because we have a short certificate for all ``Yes'' instances, it is
not clear why we should believe that the ``No'' instances also have a short
certificate. 
\item 
Proving {\bf NP=coNP} is a bigger step than {\bf P=NP}. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{theorem}
{\bf P=NP} $\Rightarrow$ {\bf NP=coNP}. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{Proof}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
 Key idea: {\bf P}  is closed under complementation, i.e., $X \in P
\Leftrightarrow \bar{X} \in P$. 
 \item 
$X \in{\bf NP} \Rightarrow X \in P \Rightarrow \bar{X} \in P \Rightarrow 
\bar{X} \in{\bf NP} \Rightarrow X \in  {\bf coNP} $, and 
\item 
$X \in co-NP \Rightarrow \bar{X} \in{\bf NP} \Rightarrow \bar{X} \in P
\Rightarrow X \in P \Rightarrow X \in NP$. 

\end{itemize}
\end{Proof}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Good characterizations: the class $ {\bf NP} \cap  {\bf coNP} $ }

If $X$ is in both {\bf NP}  and {\bf coNP}, it has a nice property:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item 
 if an instance is ``Yes'' instance, we have a short proof; 
\item 
if the input instance is a ``No'' instance, we have a short disqualification,
too. 
\end{enumerate}
Example: {\sc Maximum Flow}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
Certificate for ``Yes'' instance: list a flow of value $\ge v$ directly; 
 \item 
Certificate for ``No'' instance: list a cut whose capacity $\le v$; 
\end{itemize}
Duality immediately implies that both problems are in {\bf NP}  and $coNP$.

\frame{ 
\begin{block}{Question 3: ${\bf P} ={\bf NP} \cap  {\bf coNP} $? }
 If yes, a problem with good characterization always has an efficient algorithm.
\end{block}

\frame{ 
\frametitle{Good characterizations: the class $ {\bf NP} \cap  {\bf coNP} $ }


Mixed opinions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item finding good characterization is usually easier than designing an
efficient algorithm;
\item good characterization $\Rightarrow$ conceptual leverage in reasoning about
problems;
\item good characterization $\Rightarrow$ efficient algorithm: There are many
cases in which a problem was found to have a nontrivial good characterization;
and then (sometimes many years later) it was discovered to have a
polynomial-time algorithm. 
\end{itemize}

--- primality testing [Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena, 2002]
