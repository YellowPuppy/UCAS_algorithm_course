- **Prerequisites:**
    We will assume knowledge of:
   - Basic data structures such as lists, trees, heaps, sorting and searching;
   - Basic discrete mathematics such as proofs by mathematical induction;
   - Computability and programming experience.

## Topics:

We will cover the following topics if time permits:
   - Problem hardness, NP-completeness;
   - Algorithm analysis techniques, including worst-case and average-case, amortized, randomization, and competitive;
   - Basic algorithm techniques, including greedy, iteration, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, network flow, linear programming;
   - Algorithm techniques for hard problems, including approximation algorithms, local search, primal-dual algorithms, linear programming;
   - Randomized algorithms: basic techniques from discrete probability, and applications to optimization.
   - Specific problems from computational biology and Bioinformatics (if time permits).

## Grading policies

   8 assignments and final examination.
   
## Weekly Schedule
The week number is an active link -- each week has its own page that includes required reading, recommended reading, assignment (if any), teaching assistants, etc. Topics for weeks beyond the current and next are always tentative.
